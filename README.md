# flutter_temp

Flutter Temp is a study project made with Flutter where it's possible to convert temperatures to any measurement unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin).

It is recommended that you have installed Android Studio with an SDK and VSCode on your computer. After the installation, create an Android emulator in Android Studio. To run the project in VSCode, just install the Flutter and Dart extensions.
For the App to work in VSCode, press F1 and select 'Flutter: Launch Emulator' to select the device to be emulated or create one. It's also possible to choose the device by selecting the option 'Flutter: Select Device'. Then just press F5 to run the project.
